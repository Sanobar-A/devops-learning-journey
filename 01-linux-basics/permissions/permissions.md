# Linux Users & Permissions – Day 2

## Why permissions matter
Linux is a multi-user system. Permissions prevent unauthorized access
and protect system files.

## Permission Types
- r (read)
- w (write)
- x (execute)

## Permission Scope
- Owner
- Group
- Others

## Example
-rwxr-xr--
Owner: read, write, execute  
Group: read, execute  
Others: read only
